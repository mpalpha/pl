# What is the Securus Pattern Library?
The Securus Pattern Library is a collection of user interface design patterns. Design patterns are recurring solutions that solve common design problems. They provide a common language for people who create user interfaces.

The benefits of using a pattern library are three fold:
1. Consistency in User Experience
2. Reusability
3. Maintainability

Each pattern within this library contains suggested usages, a summary of what problem it solves, an example and the code used to build the interface.
The library is continually being updated with new patterns and code samples for existing patterns.
